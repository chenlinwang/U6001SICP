# A Plan to Program

This is the first program learning project that I am going to do for improving programming skills. This specific one is a rountine following up the MIT Open Course Ware's [U6001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/). What I am doing is taking down every notes I have during the process. Hope you enjoy it.

## Goal
My goal for this project is to:
+ Get the eccential mechanism behind
+ Improve my programming skills
+ Master scheme or lisp

## Working Sequence
I shall say that I mainly follow a squence of working like this:
+ Book Content
+ Book Exercise
+ Lecture Video and Note
+ Lecture Project
+ Lecture Extend Reading Reflect

## Content Guid
There are four directories:

+ LectureNotes: The stressed points and my thoughts from the lecture.
+ BookNotes: The stressed points and my thoughts from the book [SICP][book].
+ BookContentImpletation: The impletation of the example inside the book [SICP][book].
+ BookExercise: The excise solutions and explanations for the book [SICP][book].


## Other Resource
There are already plenty of solutions and explanations on the web, so I may as well take them down here:
