* Exercise 2.73
Section 2.3.2 described a program that performs symbolic differentiation:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (deriv exp var)
  (cond ((number? exp) 0)
        ((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))
        ((sum? exp)
         (make-sum (deriv (addend exp) var)
                   (deriv (augend exp) var)))
        ((product? exp)
         (make-sum
           (make-product (multiplier exp)
                         (deriv (multiplicand exp) var))
           (make-product (deriv (multiplier exp) var)
                         (multiplicand exp))))
<more rules can be added here>
(else (error "unknown expression type -- DERIV" exp))))
#+END_SRC
We can regard this program as performing a dispatch on the type of the expression to be differentiated. In this situation the ``type tag'' of the datum is the algebraic operator symbol (such as +) and the operation being performed is deriv. We can transform this program into data-directed style by rewriting the basic derivative procedure as:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (deriv exp var)
   (cond ((number? exp) 0)
         ((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))
         (else ((get 'deriv (operator exp)) (operands exp) var))))
(define (operator exp) (car exp))
(define (operands exp) (cdr exp))
#+END_SRC
** a
Explain what was done above. Why can't we assimilate the predicates number? and same-variable? into the data-directed dispatch?
The number and variable have no list structure for the =operator= procedure to get the tag. So it should be treated differently, unless you could wrap the number with the tag =number= or =variable=.
** b
Write the procedures for derivatives of sums and products, and the auxiliary code required to install them in the table used by the program above.
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define variable? symbol?)
(define (same-variable? exp var) (eq? exp var))
(define (put-der op proc)
  (put! 'derivitive op proc))
(define (get-der op)
  (get 'derivitive op))

(define (deriv exp var)
  (cond ((number? exp) 0)
        ((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))
        (else ((get-der (operator exp)) (operands exp) var))))

;; install the add
(define (install-derivitive-add)
  (define (add-drive arg var)
    (cons '+ (map (lambda (a) (deriv a var))
                  arg)))
  (put-der '+ add-drive)
  (print "add derivitive installed!"))

;; install the sum
(define (install-derivitive-mul)
  (define (mul-derive arg var)
    (cons '+ (map (lambda (a)
                    (cons '* (cons (deriv a var) (removemap (lambda (r) (eq? a r))
                                                            cons
                                                            (list)
                                                            arg))))
                  arg)))
  (put-der '* mul-derive)
  (print "multiply derivitive installed!"))
#+END_SRC

** c
Choose any additional differentiation rule that you like, such as the one for exponents (exercise 2.56), and install it in this data-directed system.
We choose the exponent.
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (exponent? exp) (and (pair? exp)
                             (eq? (car exp) 'exp)))

(define (install-derivitive-exp)
  (define (exp-derive arg var)
    (let ((base (car arg))
          (exp-num (cadr arg))
          (self (cons 'exp arg)))
      (cond ((number? base)
             (cond ((number? exp-num) 0)

** d
In this simple algebraic manipulator the type of an expression is the algebraic operator that binds it together. Suppose, however, we indexed the procedures in the opposite way, so that the dispatch line in deriv looked like:
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
((get (operator exp) 'deriv) (operands exp) var)
#+END_SRC
What corresponding changes to the derivative system are required?

Actually, according to the property of the property list in scheme, we just need to rewrite the =put!= procedure.
* Exercise 2.74
Insatiable Enterprises, Inc., is a highly decentralized conglomerate company consisting of a large number of independent divisions located all over the world. The company's computer facilities have just been interconnected by means of a clever network-interfacing scheme that makes the entire network appear to any user to be a single computer. Insatiable's president, in her first attempt to exploit the ability of the network to extract administrative information from division files, is dismayed to discover that, although all the division files have been implemented as data structures in Scheme, the particular data structure used varies from division to division. A meeting of division managers is hastily called to search for a strategy to integrate the files that will satisfy headquarters' needs while preserving the existing autonomy of the divisions.

Show how such a strategy can be implemented with data-directed programming. As an example, suppose that each division's personnel records consist of a single file, which contains a set of records keyed on employees' names. The structure of the set varies from division to division. Furthermore, each employee's record is itself a set (structured differently from division to division) that contains information keyed under identifiers such as address and salary. In particular:

** Answer
We could use the data-directed style, for personel from different divisions, use the division name as the tag of the data, and construct the specific method for selector. So suppose we have a procedure called =find= base on the keys name, address and salary.
** a
 Implement for headquarters a get-record procedure that retrieves a specified employee's record from a specified personnel file. The procedure should be applicable to any division's file. Explain how the individual divisions' files should be structured. In particular, what type information must be supplied?
Just begin with a tag named the division.
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (get-record name address salary)
  (let ((data (find name address salary)))
    ((get (car data) ) data)))
#+END_SRC
** b
Implement for headquarters a get-salary procedure that returns the salary information from a give employee's record from any division's personnel file. How should the record be structured in order to make this operation work?
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (get-salary id)
  (let ((data (find id)))
    ((get (car data) 'salary) data)))
#+END_SRC
** c
Implement for headquarters a find-employee-record procedure. This should search all the divisions' files for the record of a given employee and return the record. Assume that this procedure takes as arguments an employee's name and a list of all the divisions' files.
** d
When Insatiable takes over a new company, what changes must be made in order to incorporate the new personnel information into the central system?
Install a new data structure for the company.
* Exercise 2.75
Implement the constructor make-from-mag-ang in message-passing style. This procedure should be analogous to the make-from-real-imag procedure given above.
** Answer
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define (make-from-mag-ang mag ang)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'mag) mag)
          ((eq? m 'ang) ang)
          ((eq? m 'real) (* mag (cos ang)))
          ((eq? m 'imag) (* mag (sin ang)))
          (else
           (error "undefined operator -- " m))))
  dispatch)
#+END_SRC

* Exercise 2.76
As a large system with generic operations evolves, new types of data objects or new operations may be needed. For each of the three strategies -- generic operations with explicit dispatch, data-directed style, and message-passing-style -- describe the changes that must be made to a system in order to add new types or new operations. Which organization would be most appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added? Which would be most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added?
** Answer
*** Explicit dispatch
Create a new category of operators and selectors, and add these to the total dispatch.
*** data-directed style
Create those operators and selectors and register them with the =put= command.
*** message-passing-style
Create a dispatch with operators and selectors and register it with the =put= command.
