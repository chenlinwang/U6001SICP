* Problem with tagged data
If we try to implement with the tagged data, there are two problems:
1. The module is not additive, meaning if we intend to add a new data type, we need to add the new methods inside every constructor, selector and operator.
2. And we also have to guarantee that the new tag does not conflict with the present tags.

It is easy for complex number system for it only involves two tags, but imagine a system with thousands of types.
