* Symbols
In this lecture, we define a special type of data, symbols. They belongs to =EQtype= (types except number and string). The topics mainly concerns:
1. Symbols: constructor, seclector and operators
2. What is the mechanism behind it.
3. Usage
** Symbol as a data abstruction
Anything that has a =`= before it is a symbol element. we could not access to it but we could use =eq?= to tell whether two symbols are the same one.

** Mechanism
Like any special form, symbols are processed differently in the Reader. It will denote what symbol has been read and so on.

** Usage: Symbolical computations
